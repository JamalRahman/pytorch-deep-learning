# PyTorch Deep Learning Guides
## A collection of guides on practical PyTorch
---

These guides are meant to be on how to implement common DL tasks in PyTorch.
It is assumed that you have an understanding of the theory behind Neural nets, as these notebooks focus on the engineering practical side.
